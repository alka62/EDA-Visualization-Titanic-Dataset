# EDA-Visualization-Titanic-Dataset

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset** to uncover patterns, visualize relationships, and draw insights from the data.

## 🚢 Dataset - Titanic Dataset

**Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset** contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic.  
It includes features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived the disaster.

- 📂 Dataset Name: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- 📌 Source: Kaggle / open Titanic dataset

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand the data distribution and statistics.
- Visualize feature relationships using beautiful plots.
- Detect patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- Draw meaningful feature-level insights for prediction tasks.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data handling & cleaning)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualizations)
- **Seaborn** (Statistical plots)
- **Plotly** (Interactive visualizations)

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

1. **Summary Statistics**
   - Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation
   - Null value count and treatment

2. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Histograms and Boxplots for Age, Fare, etc.
   - Gender-wise survival count

3. **Correlation Matrix**
   - Heatmaps to find relationships between features

4. **Visual Insights**
   - Countplots for categorical features (Sex, Pclass, Embarked)
   - Pairplots for multivariate understanding
   - Survival rate based on Age, Class, and Gender

---

## 💡 Insights Gained

- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers from **1st class** had better chances of survival.
- Children (age < 10) had better survival chances in general.
- Most passengers embarked from port **'S'**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload the dataset `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
2. Run the Python notebook or script
3. Visualizations will be generated for each major feature
